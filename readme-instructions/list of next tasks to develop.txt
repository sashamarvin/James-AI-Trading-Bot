Current Status and Next Steps (as of 2025-05-14)

⸻

1️⃣ What We Achieved Recently:
	•	Successfully connected James AI Bot to GW in real-time simulation mode.
	•	Integrated real-time tick data streaming through get_GW_realtime_data.
	•	Completed refactoring of monitor_stock_live to handle:
	•	Live session initialization.
	•	Day rollover with NYSE calendar.
	•	Live tick monitoring and intraday tracking.
	•	Resolved issues with timezone alignment for NYSE trading hours.
	•	Implemented smooth on_tick handling for price updates.
	•	Achieved correct buy triggers during live feed.

⸻

2️⃣ What We Are Working On:

We are in the process of integrating GW buy and sell orders directly with IB Gateway:
	•	The place_order function is being developed inside ib.py to handle:
	•	Market Orders
	•	Limit Orders
	•	Stop Orders
	•	We are setting up the connection logic to:
	•	Validate the contract.
	•	Send the order to GW.
	•	Monitor execution status and log it for synchronization with James.

⸻

3️⃣ Next Planned Steps:
	1.	Integrate place_order with check_buy and check_sell:
	•	Allow James to automatically send buy/sell orders to GW when conditions are met.
	•	Add live logging for order confirmation and status tracking.
	2.	Implement Stop Loss Logic:
	•	Decide on whether to send a Stop Loss Order to GW directly or manage it on our side.
	•	The idea is to create a safety net for disconnections or sudden market drops.
	3.	Test Scenarios:
	•	Real-time mock tests for buy/sell executions.
	•	Disconnection handling (e.g., Error 1100 & 1102 observed during tests).
	•	Synchronization and recovery tests.
	4.	Enhance Logging & Alerts:
	•	Add detailed logs for every order sent, status updates, and fulfillment confirmation.
	•	Optional: Slack or email alerts for execution confirmations and disconnections.

⸻

4️⃣ Questions to Address When We Resume:
	•	Should Stop Loss Orders be sent to GW for redundancy or handled entirely by James?
	•	Do we want a timeout logic in case an order remains pending for too long?
	•	Should partial fills trigger a follow-up or be handled differently in live mode?

When you come back, we can pick up exactly from here and proceed with the place_order logic integration and testing.

Would you like me to start preparing the structured logic for place_order in ib.py to save time for when you are back?
