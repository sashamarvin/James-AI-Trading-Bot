LIST OF THINGS TO DO AI BOT

	1.	Verify compatibility of check_buy, check_sell, detect_trend_mode with real-time data
	2.	Fetch last closed trading day based on market calendar
	3.	Generate 6-month daily history for last closed day using IB.py
	4.	Store daily history in CSV for reference during live monitoring
	5.	Stream real-time ticks from IB Gateway with get_GW_realtime_data
	6.	Continuously feed ticks into check_buy and check_sell
	7.	Implement live snapshot mechanism to save state after each event
	8.	Double-write strategy to avoid snapshot corruption
	9.	Log each trade attempt and broker confirmation
	10.	Retry logic for failed orders with 3 attempts then alert
	11.	Real-time logs for confirmations and rejections
	12.	Resume capability on restart using the latest snapshot
	13.	Recalculate if data is missing or inconsistent
	14.	Detect network or market halts and handle with reconnect or alert
	15.	Local test with mocked live data for end-to-end simulation
	16.	VPS test with IB Gateway to observe live market behavior

	1.	Verify compatibility of check_buy, check_sell, detect_trend_mode with real-time data
we done this

	2.	Fetch last closed trading day based on market calendar
we already have this function in IB.py
	3.	Generate 6-month daily history for last closed day using IB.py
already working
	4.	Store daily history in CSV for reference during live monitoring
already working
	5.	Stream real-time ticks from IB Gateway with get_GW_realtime_data
to do and for now we need to find a way to test and reuse what we have in the simulation, looking forward to anticipate exactly what will happen on real time trading days, for the current day and for the next trading session
	6.	Continuously feed ticks into check_buy and check_sell
we need to use what we have in simulation replicating all the real time events
	7.	Implement live snapshot mechanism to save state after each event
we can do this after all is flawless
	8.	Double-write strategy to avoid snapshot corruption
same
	9.	Log each trade attempt and broker confirmation
we can only assume on this and test when it happens for real when market is open, we have no data and no experience of this
	10.	Retry logic for failed orders with 3 attempts then alert
same
	11.	Real-time logs for confirmations and rejections
same
	12.	Resume capability on restart using the latest snapshot
next phase
	13.	Recalculate if data is missing or inconsistent
	14.	Detect network or market halts and handle with reconnect or alert
	15.	Local test with mocked live data for end-to-end simulation
	16.	VPS test with IB Gateway to observe live market behavior

Revised List of To-Do Tasks:
	1.	Stream real-time ticks from IB Gateway with get_GW_realtime_data.
	2.	Anticipate and simulate behavior for current trading day and next trading session.
	3.	Replicate all real-time events from simulation into live feed, integrating with check_buy and check_sell.
	4.	Implement a testing mechanism to mock real-time data for local testing.
	5.	Validate and adjust handling of real-time events to match simulation logic.
	6.	Prepare live monitoring logic for seamless transition into real-time streaming.
	7.	Perform a local test with the real-time logic using mock data.
	8.	Deploy on VPS to observe live market behavior and iterate from there.

Next Steps:
	1.	Begin with step 1: Stream real-time ticks and attempt to connect to the IB GW during non-market hours to check connectivity.
	2.	Implement local mock logic to simulate ticks if the market is closed.
	3.	Ensure we are feeding the ticks to check_buy and check_sell exactly as we do in the simulation.

Do you want me to start with step 1 and we go from there?...
